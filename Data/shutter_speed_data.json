      "text": "Shutter speed is the amount of time the camera's shutter is open. A fast shutter speed (like 1/1000s) freezes motion, while a slow shutter speed (like 1/30s) captures blur and movement.\n\nThe pinwheel shows how fast and slow shutter speeds create different visual effects.",

      "text": "Fast shutter: typically used to capture motion, such as such as a starry night or a flowing waterfall. \nSlow shutter: ideal for freezing moments, like the intense moments of athletes competing. \n The right shutter speed can balance both freezing the moment and capturing motion in a single photo.",
