    "text": "Aperture is the opening in a lens that controls how much light enters the camera—wider apertures (like f/1.8) let in more light and create a blurry background, while narrower apertures (like f/16) let in less light and keep more of the scene in focus.",

    "text": "Depth of field is directly affected by aperture—a wide aperture (like f/1.8) creates a shallow depth of field, blurring the background, while a narrow aperture (like f/16) results in a deep depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focus.",
